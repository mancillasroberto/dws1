					<p><em>Esports</em> (also known as eSports, e-sports, competitive gaming, electronic sports, or progaming in Korea) is a term for organized multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Tournaments such as The International Dota 2 Championships, the League of Legends World Championship, the Battle.net World Championship Series, the Evolution Championship Series, the Intel Extreme Masters, provide both live broadcasts of the competition, and cash prizes to competitors.</p>
					<p>Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, competitions have seen a large surge in popularity from the late 2000s and early 2010s. While competitions around 2000 were largely between amateurs, the proliferation of professional competitions and growing viewership now supports a significant number of professional players and teams,[1] and many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate such competition.</p>
					<p>The genre of fighting games and arcade fighters have also been popular in amateur tournaments, although the fighting game community has often distanced themselves from the eSports label.[2] In 2012, the most popular titles featured in professional competition were the multiplayer online battle arena games Dota 2, League of Legends, and the real time strategy game StarCraft II.[3] Shooting games like Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2,and Call of Duty have enjoyed some success as eSports, although their viewer numbers have remained below those of their competitors.[4]</p>
